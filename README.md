# Tello-Template
Designed for Ms.Ghents class to get easier use out of Tello coding.

Ignore the testing.py file, it does nothing.

# TO USE:
- Make sure you have the following pip extensions installed. (Image attached bellow)
- In your terminal, run the command: ``pip install easytello``
- Should be all set, just don't get rid of the import line.
